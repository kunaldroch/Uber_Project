• Project Overview:
  
This project demonstrates data analysis skills using Uber booking data. The dataset contains **simulated Uber bookings in Chandigarh for the month of August**, with approximately 1 lakh rows.  

The project showcases the following skills:  
  - Data manipulation and analysis using **Excel**  
  - Interactive dashboards using **Power BI**  
  - Querying and data extraction using **SQL**  

• Project Structure:
  
  - `scripts/` → Contains SQL scripts used to query and analyze the data.  
  - `data/` → Contains:  
    - `Chandigarh_August_Bookings.xlsx` → Excel file for analysis and Power BI dashboards.  
    - `Chandigarh_August_Bookings_(CSV).csv` → CSV file for running SQL queries.  
  - `dashboards/` → Contains Power BI dashboards visualizing key metrics and insights.  

•  Using the CSV file for SQL:

  4. Run the scripts in the `scripts/` folder against the imported table.  

•  Using Excel and Power BI: 

  1. Open Excel files in the `data/` folder for analysis.  
  2. Open Power BI dashboards from the `dashboards/` folder to explore interactive visualizations.  

• Skills Highlighted:
